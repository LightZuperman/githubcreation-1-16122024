<h1>The Study Of Bees</h1>
<div class="textbox">
    <img src="./atteli/Bee_minecraft.png" class="beeimage">
    <p>Bees are fascinating and vital creatures that play a critical role in the health of our ecosystems. 
        As pollinators, they transfer pollen between flowers while foraging for nectar, helping plants 
        reproduce and produce fruits, seeds, and flowers. This process supports biodiversity and sustains agricultural production, 
        as bees pollinate a wide variety of crops, including fruits, vegetables, and nuts. There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide, and they 
        exhibit incredible social structures, with colonies typically consisting of a queen, worker bees, and drones. Worker bees, for example, gather food, 
        care for the queen and larvae, and protect the hive. Despite their importance, bees are facing numerous threats, such as habitat destruction, pesticide use, 
        disease, and climate change, which have led to a decline in bee populations. Their survival is crucial not only for maintaining food supplies but also for preserving t
        he overall balance of natural ecosystems. Protecting and supporting bee populations is vital for a healthy planet.</p>
